# ubuntu-mono-ligaturized
Ubuntu Mono font with programming ligatures.

This is a direct export from https://github.com/ToxicFrog/Ligaturizer, [release 4](https://github.com/ToxicFrog/Ligaturizer/releases/tag/v4).

This repo was created so that the fonts can be hosted on GitHub and UNPKG, for demo use in code samples.
